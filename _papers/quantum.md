For my quantum computing course, I surveyed the theoretical impacts of quantum computing techniques on existing cryptographic methods. This report focused on the high-level concepts and mathematics used to create the existing quantum algorithms that speed up cracking cryptographic algorithms (provided a fast, error-resistant quantum computer is invented). The paper explores using quantum computers to solve large coprime factoring and solving discrete logs.
