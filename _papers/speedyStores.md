A great friend of mine, Camden Fergen, and I worked on a project to measure the performance of several on-device databases when deployed to restricted-resource embedded systems. 

We used a BeagleBone Black development board, which provided enough room for a Debian install, the database libraries, and the small testing framework we developed to be loaded onto the board. To develop the testing framework, we modified YCSB, an existing database performance tool, then compiled it down into a small executable.
