My team designed a few simplified computer processors that adheres to the MIPS ISA. While I had to be familiar with the technical behavior of computer structures like ALUs and branch predictors, the most challenging part of the course was  interconnected many small components to created a desired behavior. It's easy to develop something in isolation, but introducing that component into a larger system is truly difficult. This course was most about large-system design, and learning how to reliably keep track of components and the functional responsibilities of each of those components.
