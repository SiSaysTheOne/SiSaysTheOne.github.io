FireBot was an ambitious team project in my embedded systems course. The system we programmed is a Roomba. 

The bot is controlled through a GUI which presents the operator with a list of commands and a top-down map of everything the robot has seen since it was powered on and connected to the GUI server. 

A wooden frame was constructed to sit above the bot. This frame holds a few speakers controlled by a text-to-speech program, which blurts out fire warnings at the operator's command. The operator can also trigger a compressed air to fire with a servo, which emulates a fire hose.
