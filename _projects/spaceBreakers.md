This project was my first team-based coding project that lasted an entire semester. We learned object-oriented programming as a group to develop a game in the same vein as Galaga. In order to create smooth paths of enemy ships to follow, I created logic for enemy object to follow a special path called a Bezier curve. To complement this, I created a Desmos graph for making a custom curve for people who didn't want to bother with the math; it was a plug-and-play tool.
