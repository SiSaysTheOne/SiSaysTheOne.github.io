## Internship with PFG

<!-- My internship experience with PFG involved data protection technologies across the technical spectrum<br/><img src='/images/puzzle.png'> -->

Date: Summer 2025
Employer: Principal Financial Group

At Principal, I assisted the data protection team in their mission to secure sensitive data and communication. 

I started my experience by collecting, refining and interpreting KMS key data for the organization's cloud applications using Snowflake SQL and Power BI. These keys serve as an easy way for developers to encrypt data, but often get forgotten or discarded without documentation, leading to waste.

My next project was to build a system to interface with the BigID API to inform data owners about exposed data products in on-prem datastores. First, I enumerated useful API endpoints. Then, I created an AWS CDK architecture to routinely poll the API endpoints, refine the BigID data, and present actionable information to data owners.

In the middle of my experience, I participated in the intern code jam. My team developed the skeleton of a game designed for financial literacy and presented to a wide swath of the corporation.

In my time between project work, I contributed to the inner-source pool of AWS constructs. I addressed issues on the GitHub tasks list that weren't being picked up by any other developers. I also took out time to learn how to use the Proofpoint and Zscalar DLP tools.

During my last few weeks, I helped perform an audit on a subset of our on-prem databases to determine if they were adequately meeting CIS benchmarks. I was specifically checking the existence of automated checks run on our databases using the Guardium tool.

Near the end of my experience, I presented an informal showcase of my work to my fellow interns. At the end of my internship, my performance was rated "very successful."
