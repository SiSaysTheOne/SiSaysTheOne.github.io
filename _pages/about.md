# Career Objective
My aim is to establish a career in cybersecurity. Throughout the next decades, I want to be continually challenged, learning more about cybersecurity from low-level hardware to high-level software services. I want to work among people who share a mutual respect for those around them, and who intend to make tangible, positive impacts on the communities of the world.
