## Description of project  

We will be developing a CTF pack that teachers can leverage to familiarize students with computer architecture and the vulnerabilities that have been observed on common low-level computer constructs. Exploits on memory caches and branch prediction mechanisms are powerful enough to leak information about encryption keys, which threatens data-protection efforts.

Specter and page-eviction attacks are two of the most prolific microarchitectural exploits. Both have been demonstrated as high-severity attack vectors on popular computer architecutres.

## My role  

My role is illustrating the high-level behavior of our CTF platform. I will identify the responsibilities of our web server and our backend server (as well as how the servers communicate) to provide end-users a strong educational experience. I will be auditing the behavior of our servers to ensure our platform is meeting our standards.

<!-- //todo pare down, integrate into the previous paragraph
It's difficult to actually run hardware-level exploits as a service. It difficult for virtual machines and containerized applications to accurately execute hardware attacks. Even if we managed to execute real exploits, our servers may crash as a result; exploits can be unpredictable and dangerous. To compensate, we need to simulate the attacks like and interactive textbook would. I will have to pick up the skills that allow me to identify the crucial elements of an exploit so that we can present all the actions and information necessary to execute the attack in an actual environment.  -->

## Impact of our project

I hope our contribution to hardware-level cybersecurity education will put more eyeballs on the subject and drive more research and innovation in this field. The more excellent minds working to prevent and mitigate hardware vulnerabilities, the more secure the world's computer systems will be.
